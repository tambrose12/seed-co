            <p> Hope & Hunter Seed Co. is run out of the backyard of a small family in South Carolina, named after the two sweet kids that love to garden with their grandmother. Grandma spent a lot of years learning how to garden, and how to gather seeds from her garden to replant the following year or season. Hope & Hunter work very hard to help their grandma in the garden, and love to see the beautiful flowers and tasty fruit and veggies they grow together every year.</p>
            <p>Now they would like to share that love and excitment with you!</p>
            <p>Shop their seeds to plant your own garden full of bright and beautiful flowers, fruit, and vegetables. We hope you can love your garden as much as we do!</p>
